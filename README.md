## Breast Cancer detection using Logistic Regression
Aim of this notebook is to detect breast cancer by applying a logistic regression model on a real-world dataset and predict whether a tumor is benign (not breast cancer) or malignant (breast cancer) based off its characteristics.

Logistic regression can identify important predictors of breast cancer using odds ratios and generate confidence intervals that provide additional information for decision-making. Model performance depends on the ability of the radiologists to accurately identify findings on mammograms.

### More info Logistic Regression
In data science, logistic regression is a machine learning algorithm used for classification problems and predictive analysis. It is a method of statistical analysis used to predict a data value based on prior observations of a dataset. A logistic regression model predicts the value of a dependent variable by analyzing the relationship between one or more existing independent variables.

For a better context outside of healthcare here are some real-world applications of logistical regression:
- Bankruptcy predictions
- Credit scoring
- Consumer behavior
- Customer retention
- Spam detection
